# Setting up your environment
Depending your code editor or IDE of preference, the steps to setup your python environment may vary. In this repository, I am going to present the steps to be followed to setup your environment on:
- Visual Studio Code (*Recommended*)
- Pycharm

## Visual Studio Code Setup

1. Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Install the extension `Python` by **Microsoft** (_other extensions for python will automatically be installed_)
4. Create a file with the extension: 
    - `.py` to create a python script
    - `.ipynb` to create a jupyter notebook

## Pycharm Setup

1. Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download and install [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows) (_Choose the free version_)
3. Create a project and get started.
