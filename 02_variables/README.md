# Variables

[**Variables**](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Variables_and_Types) are one of the most fundamental concepts in programming. They are not specific to python and exist in pretty much every programming language. 

We use variables to temporarily store data in a computerâ€™s memory.

# Types of variables

In python, you do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare their data type. This is because python is completely object oriented, i.e every variable in python is an object.

## Numbers

Python supports two types of numbers - integers(whole numbers) and floating point numbers(decimals). 

To define numbers in python, we use the following syntaxes:

### Integers
```python
number = 5
```

### Floating point numbers
```python
number = 4.5
```

## Strings
[**Strings**](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp) in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

`'hello'` is the same as `"hello"`.

The difference between the two is that using double quotes makes it easy to include apostrophes.

### Multiline Strings
You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes (_single or double_):
```python
message = '''
Hi stranger!
Hope you are doing well.

This is a repository in which I write all my notes as I am learning how to code in Python.
Hope it helps you remember concepts you might have forgotten.

Stay safe ðŸ˜Š
'''
```


# Rules to create variables in Python

- A variable can consist of upper and lowercase letters, digits (_0-9_) and the underscore character.
- The first character of a variable cannot be a digit.
- Keywords like **if** or the Boolean **True** are reserved and cannot be used as variable names.
- Variables are case-sensitive; therefore `porosity` is different from `POROSITY`, `Porosity`, `PoRoSiTy`.

### Recommended Pratices

- Use snake_case for variable names that contain spaces
- Donâ€™t use names that look like the digits 1 and 0 (such as lowercase L)

# Example

```python
area = 1750
water_saturation = 0.3  # 30%
branch = 'Petroleum Engineering'
```

When the python interpreter executes this code, it will:
- Allocate some memory, 
- Store the number **1750** in that memory 
- Attach the `area` label to that memory location

The scenario is the same for the other variables.

# Exercise

Letâ€™s say you want to calculate the oil in place (OIP) for a hydrocarbon reservoir. To do so, you need to know various reservoir parameters such as the **area**, the **thickness**, the **porosity** and the **water saturation**.

Using the following data, create variables to store the values of those parameters using python syntax.

### Data

|Parameter                        | Value (units)                                 |
|---------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
|Area of the zone (A)             | 2000 acres                                    |
|Thickness (h)                    | 150 ft                                        |
|Porosity (Ï•)                     | 15%                                           |
|Water saturation (Sw)            | 30%                                           |
