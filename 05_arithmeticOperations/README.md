# Arithmetic Operations

We have learned that there are two (02) types of numbers in python, integers (whole numbers) and floating point numbers (decimals).
```python
number1 = 10  # integer
number2 = 10.123  # float
```

Python supports numerous arithmetic operations including **addition**, **substraction**, **multiplication**, **divsion**, ...etc.

### Examples

```python
sum = 10 + 3
diff = 10 - 3
prod = 10 * 3
quot = 10 / 3
mod = 10 % 3  # remainder of the division of 10 by 3
power = 10 ** 3

number = 1 + 2 * 3 / 4.0
```

# Exercise

Based on the following reservoir inputs parameters:
- Calculate the oil originally in place (OIP)
- Calculate the stock tank oil originally in place (STOOIP)

|Parameter                        | Value (units)                                 |
|---------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
|Area of the zone (A)             | 2000 acres                                    |
|Thickness (h)                    | 150 ft                                        |
|Porosity (Ï•)                     | 15%                                           |
|Water saturation (Sw)            | 30%                                           |
|Oil formation volume factor (Bo) | 1.65 (reservoir bbl per stock tank bbl)       |
