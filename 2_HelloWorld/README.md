# Output
To display information in python, we use the built-in funtion [**`print()`**](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_print.asp). Depending on whether we want to display a simple message or the value of a variable, this function can be used in several ways.

## Displaying a simple message
To display a simple message, all we have to do is write the message we want to be printed in single or double quotes within the [**`print()`**](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_print.asp) function.

### Example
```python
print('Hello World!')
print('Hello', 'how are you?') # Displays the two messages seperated by a space 
```
